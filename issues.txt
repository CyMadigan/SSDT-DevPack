trying to parse publish profile (didn't exist so crashed)

if dacpac not built then does't work (target invocation error)

- if you don't actually save anything, nothing will happen
- doesn't sink with vs events as shouldn't be used very often - if you don't see what you expect, build the project and click refresh
- if a merge statement cannot be parsed then it is skipped, if you expect it to be there then click refresh and then check the t-sql
- identity inserts hmm not sure what to do about this.
- can't delete
